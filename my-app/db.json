Its pristine lakes, refreshing waterfalls, gorgeous botanical gardens, lush tea gardens and rich flora and fauna are just some of the reasons why travellers flock to this ethereal hill station known to locals as Udhagamandalam.",
      "about-p1": "A 100-year-old colonial bungalow set amidst the soft meadows of Tamil Nadu’s favourite picnic spot, goSTOPS Ooty is both charming and convenient. Just a few kilometres away from the city centre and yet secluded, goSTOPS Ooty occupies a prime location. As you arrive, the perfectly manicured garden with tall vines hugging pillars greet you at the entrance of the heritage bungalow. Surrounded by trees and nature, the property feels like a private getaway from the rest of the hill station. Inside, you’ll be welcomed by the friendly staff and a reception that retains the vintage charm of the bungalow with a fun, hip vibe. An antique table with mirrors, double doors that open up the space, a wooden umbrella rack filled with an assortment of colourful umbrellas and a fireplace that brings a pop of colour, all add to the vibrant interiors within the white walls of the villa.",
      "about-p2": "When you check in to the private room, you’ll be greeted by a seating area complete with a wooden table and chairs to match.

The vintage dressing table and towering cupboard will tempt you to immediately unpack as you set your backpack down on the patterned wooden floor.",

Connect with nature by walking barefoot on the lawn as you feel the warm embrace of the morning sun on your back. Zone out on a hammock with a book or sip on a cup of freshly brewed tea from a neighbouring tea estate as you lounge in your room on grand, vintage chairs.",

Exchange notes on your adventures with guests as you watch a sunset, warm your palms over a cosy bonfire and chomp on roasted marshmallows.

      "about-p2": "With an aim to provide the guests more than just a pleasant stay, goSTOPS has stepped beyond accommodation and has launched goEXPERIENCES to bring together a close-knit community of travellers. The goEXPERIENCES program is made up of five segments providing a varying sense of thrill to experienced and new travellers alike.",
      "about-p3": "This is possibly one of the prettiest alpine meadow treks in Himachal Pradesh. A three-day trek will take you by glacial lakes and verdant meadows surrounded by snow-capped mountains. The Bhrigu lake is sacred to the locals and is said to be the place where Maharshi Bhrigu meditated thousands of years ago. On this trek, you can look forward to lush grasslands, the surrounding peaks of the Pir Panjal range and streams gushing along trails. What better way to rejuvenate yourself at the end of the day than to soak in views of the shimmering Bhrigu lake?",
      "about-p4": "If you are lucky, you may also chance upon the Himalayan Monal or the Western Tragopan, state birds of Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh respectively, in the meadows surrounding the Bhrigu lake. This trek to Bhrigu Lake, with goEXPERIENCES, has all the right elements to make you fall in love with the Himalayas.",
      "activity-p1": "A perfect blend of culture and natural beauty, this popular trek by goEXPERIENCES is sure to pull in culture seekers and nature lovers. Coniferous forests give way to vast expanses of lush green meadows and slopes dotted with ancient village stone houses, giving you a feeling of being a part of history.",
      "activity-p2": "Har ki Dun is also known as the Valley of the Gods and one visit will tell you why the name is apt. The Swargarohini peaks, believed by many to be the stairway to heaven, overlook the entire trek. Several 2000-year-old villages dot the valley and the villagers are some of the friendliest people you’ll come across. This cradle-shaped valley in the heart of Gobind Ballabh Pant National Park is surrounded by several peaks other than Swargarohini. Camping in the meadows beside flowing streams under the watchful eyes of these peaks is a surreal experience you need to have at least once in your life.",
